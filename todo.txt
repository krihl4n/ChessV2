    capture tracker on en passant?
    possibly every instance of position tracker should be tied to separate instances of objects with state
    check mate
    stalemate
    can king being in check castle?
    resign
    draw
    user can choose a figure when pawn reaches the end
    rematch
    insufficient material results in a draw
    when pawn reaches the end, it can change to chosen

* undoing in actual game

* security, accounts etc
 //todo later on it will have to be send to specific user who can have multiple sessions

* persistence

 mongo
 optimistic locking
 reversing moves will be a pain.. need to store commands? o_0 <== event sourcing
