* game rules
    capture tracker on en passant?
    possibly every instance of position tracker should be tied to separate instances of objects with state
    check mate
    stalemate
    resign
    draw
    user can choose a figure when pawn reaches the end
    rematch
    insufficient material results in a draw
    when pawn reaches the end, it can change to chosen figure

* undoing in actual game

* security, accounts etc
 //todo later on it will have to be send to specific user who can have multiple sessions

* persistence
 save played games to a file
 mongo
 optimistic locking
 reversing moves will be a pain.. need to store commands? o_0 <== event sourcing

* bugs
** move observer not notified when redoing the move, bug probably with right to castle

** en passant error
 e2 e4
 d2 d4
 possible moves from d4: d5, d3
 should be: d3

** redo actions not cleared
    move piece
    undo
    move another piece
    redo
    redo is performed


* some persistent logs. logback?

* game phases
    * start
    * finish
    * check mate
    * notify about checks

* modes
- free play
- hot seat

maybe pieces should remember their positions? or maybe not
